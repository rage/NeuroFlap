  <div id="game_div"> </div>

  <p>Input your student number:
  <input type="text" name="studentid" id="student_id" size="30" maxlength="70"></p>

  <p>Press arrow keys to move. Don't touch the green blocks and try to keep on the vertical line. The line turns red if you are too far from it.</p>

  <p>Use W, A, S and D keys to react to shapes. If the shape you see is the same that was given at the start of the game, press W. If it is some other shape, press S. At the same time, press A if the shape is red and press D if the shape is green.</p>

  <p>So, A + W for the red right shape and A + S for a red wrong shape. W + D for the green right shape and S + D for a green wrong shape.</p>

  <p>The screen flashes based on your reactions. If you pressed the right keys, the screen flashes green, if you pressed wrong it flashes red. If you didn't react in time, it flashes yellow.</p>
